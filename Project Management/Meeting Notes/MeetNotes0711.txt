Meeting Notes:
Interface design for now:
-Input: Recepters for a specific domain
	-Treeview of domains and under each domain to specify receptor
	-Checkbox yes/no to involve the receptor
	-Open editor to edit the receptor using cmd or win + R to open editor
	-Display confirmation of input before execution of simulation
	-Save execution cmd messages to a file 
	-Option to display output stats of receptors (yes/no)
	-Option to display result map (yes/no).
	-Option to display filtered receptors results (eg. receptors with numbers above a certain condition)
	-Able to alert filtered result before finishing the execution of entire program (If feasible)

By July 13th:
	A10: Able to open editor and edit receptor. Runnning the whole process by a single execution
